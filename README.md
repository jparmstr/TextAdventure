# TextAdventure
A windows console application in VB.net for a text adventure game.

This is a work in progress.

I'm challenging myself to develop a text-based adventure game engine that runs as a Windows Console Application. This should be beneficial because it will let me relatively quickly tackle advanced design-related issues without having to worry about graphics, audio, performance, and so on.

I'm also thinking about Natural Language Processing - isolating the part of the program that interprets user input.
